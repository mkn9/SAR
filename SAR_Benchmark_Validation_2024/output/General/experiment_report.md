# SAR Benchmark Validation 2024 - Experiment Report
Generated: 2025-08-26 20:51:38

## Experiment Overview
This experiment validates our SAR model implementation against three major 
operational SAR systems:
- TerraSAR-X (X-band, 9.65 GHz, 300 MHz bandwidth)
- RADARSAT-2 (C-band, 5.405 GHz, 100 MHz bandwidth)  
- Sentinel-1 (C-band, 5.405 GHz, 56.5 MHz bandwidth)

## Validation Methodology
Each SAR system is tested for:
1. Mathematical accuracy (range resolution, wavelength, chirp rate)
2. Point target response accuracy
3. Processing gain validation
4. Time-bandwidth product verification

## Results Summary
- Total experiments: 3
- Successful experiments: 3
